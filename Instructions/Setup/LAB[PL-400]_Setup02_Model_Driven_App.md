# Supplementary/Setup Lab Instructions – Model driven app

## Scenario

In this lab we will continue to build on top of the Microsoft Dataverse components created in the previous lab. We will now build a Power Apps model-driven app to allow the office staff manage records for the inspectors and the inspectors to manage their own records as needed.

## High-level lab steps

As part of creating the model-driven app, you will complete the following:

- Create a new model-driven app named Permit Management
- Edit the app navigation to reference the required tables
- Customize the forms and views of the required tables for the app

**Views**: As the name suggests, this helps viewing the existing data in the form of table. This is the configuration of the columns that will be displayed on the screen.

**Forms**: This is where the user creates/updates new records in the tables.

Both will be integrated to the model-driven app for a better user-experience.

The following is what the model-driven app designer looks like when all the customizations are completed:

## Things to consider before you begin

- What changes should we make to improve the user experience?
- What should we include in a model-driven app based on the data model we’ve built?
- What customizations can be made on the sitemap of a model-driven app?
- Remember to continue working in your DEVELOPMENT environment. We’ll move everything to production once everything is built and tested.

## Starter solution

A starter solution file for this lab can be found in the  C:\Labfiles\L02\Starter folder.

## Completed solution

A completed solution file for this lab can be found in the  C:\Labfiles\L02\Completed folder.
