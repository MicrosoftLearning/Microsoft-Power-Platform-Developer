# Lab Setup Instructions 3 – Canvas app

## Scenario

As we continue to build our solution, we will now design a Power Apps canvas app that the inspectors will use in the field on their mobile devices. Canvas apps are low code apps that can be designed for a tablet or mobile phone layouts. You will build a two-screen canvas app that allows inspectors quickly access and process the inspections.

## High-level lab steps

We will follow the below basic steps to design the canvas app:

- Create the app using the tablet form factor.
- Connect to Microsoft Dataverse as a data source.
- Configure a gallery control to show the pending inspections.
- Use a Microsoft Dataverse view to populate the gallery.
- Configure a detail page with inspection info.
- Handle saving the inspection results to Microsoft Dataverse.
- Export the solution with the data model and apps and import it to the “Production” environment.

This is the first screen of the application, it will show all Pending Inspections for the logged in Inspector.

This second screen it will let the inspector update the selected Inspection.

## Things to consider before you begin

- What would an inspector need quick access to while in the field?
- How do we move our solution from the development to the production environment?
- Remember to continue working in your DEVELOPMENT environment. We’ll move everything to production in Exercise 2 of this lab.
